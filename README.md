# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – 6th Semester

This repository contains lab assignments and implementations of key Artificial Intelligence algorithms as part of the 6th semester AI Lab course.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is to provide hands-on experience with foundational AI algorithms and techniques. It helps students understand and implement intelligent systems that can solve problems through search and decision-making. The lab emphasizes the practical use of AI concepts using Python programming.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Implementation of classical **search algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and A\*
- ♟️ Development of **game-playing agents** using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning
- 📚 Modular Python code with helpful comments and documentation
- 📝 Includes sample inputs, outputs, and clearly defined problem statements
- 🚀 Strong focus on understanding the logic and structure behind intelligent problem solving

## 🗂️ Lab Topics (Covered)

| No. | Experiment Title | Description |
|-----|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Breadth-First Search (BFS) | Traverses a graph level by level |
| 2 | Depth-First Search (DFS) | Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking |
| 3 | A\* Search | Uses heuristics to find the shortest path |
| 4 | Minimax Algorithm | Builds a decision tree for two-player turn-based games |
| 5 | Alpha-Beta Pruning | Optimizes the minimax algorithm by pruning unneeded branches |
